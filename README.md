# Indian Anchors Turn News into Daily Soaps

## An analysis of the prime-time debates and their point of focus. Hint: The focus is everything, but vital issues. 

This is my submission for the 2023 Lede Program's fourth project. 

### Goal
This project was inspired by an independent news outlet Newslaundry and focuses on what Prime Time anchors are debating in India. 

### Findings
Through my analysis, I found that many mainstream TV anchors not only blatantly support the current government but also cherry-pick facts to encourage its propaganda. These anchors are the few journalists who have interviewed the current Indian Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi. Often they debate about communal divisive topics, undermining the Muslim community in India. 

### Data collection
1. I manually collected the data from the news channels' official website and rechecked it over and over again. 
2. Finally the data was categorized based on important and consistent themes in the data.
3. This resembled a qualitative research format but was very engaging. 

### New skills
- Building stories through manual data collection. 
- Learning video masthead in visualization.
- Accepting that HTML codes can be really time-consuming. 
  
### What I couldn't do 
1. I wasn't able to use scrolly-telling and I will continue building on this project to use it enxt. 

3. ### What will I do next time 
1. Use my time better and use Scrollama.
